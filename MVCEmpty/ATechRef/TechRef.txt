Empty Project Configuration from scratch

1)EnableFriendlyUrls
====================
To generate a friendly URL without extensions, and add routing to your web application (similar to MVC projects) by using ASP.NET Friendly Urls.
ASP.NET Friendly Urls also add View switching functionality so you can easily between a mobile view and desktop view.
 install the package “Microsoft.AspNet.FriendlyUrls”[Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.FriendlyUrls]
 If you do not have an existing RouteConfig class (like in our project), a new RouteConfig.csfile
 call EnableFriendlyUrls() in your RegisterRoutes method *before* any existing route registrations.
2)Add Global.asax 
 ==================
 and call RouteConfig.RegisterRoutes method
3)Enable Web Optimization techniques such as Bundling and Minification
 =======================================================================
 Install NuGet package : Microsoft.AspNet.Web.Optimization.WebForms
 Add a Bundle.config file to your project and define the CSS bundle
 Turn on bundling and minification - by setting with the EnableOptimizations property on the BundleTable class. So, if you want to turn on bundling and minification with debug=true, then add a BundleConfig.cs file to your App_Start folder 
 update Global.asax to call BundleConfig.RegisterBundles
